    <h1>Example Structure: The Call</h1>

    <h2 class="green-heading">❗ Motivation and Definition</h2>
    <p>Change happens in the world when people feel compelled to take action. And if you think about it, this idea makes for a really great story. It introduces some interesting tools:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>One character, or a set of characters, who desire something and make the conscious, active choice to pursue that something.</li>
      <li>Because you have a character pursuing something, they might have obstacles they need to overcome to get that something.</li>
      <li>And because your character is actively choosing to pursue, the choices they make in response to those obstacles might force them to come to terms with the consequences of what they're doing. Each time they overcome an obstacle, the change they want to achieve might become more motivated, more nuanced, and more interesting.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In this structure, without The Call, the story cannot begin. If you create an incredibly justified, interesting Call, it might form an interesting contrast against the Ordinary World, and make the decisions of your characters that much stronger throughout the rest of the story.</p>

    <h2 class="red-heading">❓ Caveats</h2>
    <p>If you require The Call, or you require that your character(s) accept The Call, you aren't able to write stories about characters who refuse to make change, know to make change, or make change without strong reason or purpose (passive change). This is limiting. For example, it prevents you from writing certain stories about teenagers who don't understand why they do the things they do, or certain stories about clinically depressed or otherwise demotivated characters who see no reason to make change.</p>
