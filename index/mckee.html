    <h1>Defining Your Story With the McKee Triangle</h1>

    <h2 class="green-heading">‚ùì Overview</h2>
    <p>Robert McKee comes up with a lot of guidelines for how to write stories and how to think about them. One of these guidelines is called the McKee Triangle -- it's a system for determining what your story serves to do, and how it serves to do these things. Let's run through each corner of the McKee Triangle in turn.</p>

    <h2 class="red-heading">‚õ∞Ô∏è 1 The Archplot</h2>
    <p>The Archplot is very similar to the structure I described in my article on story structure. It's a story about someone who receives a call to action and then goes through several escalating trials, sacrifices something, and then makes some change. McKee argues that this kind of structure resonates universally with people. You might agree -- if you do, consider forming your structure around the archplot in order to engage the majority.</p>

    <h2 class="blue-heading">üåá 2 The Miniplot</h2>
    <p>To make a Miniplot, McKee argues that you start with the Archplot as a baseline and then reduce it. Markers of a Miniplot include a less affecting climax, a more open ending, and potentially passive characters (characters who do not actively make change and engage with conflict). These stories will often still involve conflict. Who do you think this kind of story appeals to? Does it sound more 'artistic' than the Archplot? Why or why not?</p>

    <h2 class="green-heading">üåã 3 The Antiplot</h2>
    <p>In contrast with the Miniplot's reduction of the Archplot, the Antiplot instead reverses the Archplot form. These stories often revel in their non-traditionality -- they may contain no conflict and no clear sense of structure. Instead, these stories often prioritise style, extravagance, and self-conscious overstatement. Have you experienced any stories that could be interpreted as an Antiplot? Did you experience them as a reversal of the Archplot, or as something more singular?</p>

    <h2 class="red-heading">üî∫ Try it Yourself</h2>
    <p>Drag the circle to where you think your story fits in the McKee Triangle. Does this tool help you understand the purpose of your story?</p>
