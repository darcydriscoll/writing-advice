    <h1>Reflection</h1>

    <p>Here are some lessons I've learned whilst making 'How Stories Might Work'.</p>

    <h2 class="green-heading">üìî Making use of the web as a visual medium produces high-quality websites</h2>
    <p>Overall, I'm comfortable with the visual quality of my website. I think my colour palette is consistent and calming to look at, and my index page is clear and engaging. However, I did not focus on the visual quality of my article pages. While I believe their content is of high quality, I did not deeply consider their quality on an aesthetic or entertainment level. This means that some of my articles are text-heavy and boring.</p>
    <p>In future, I will think about form and function simultaneously: what kinds of content can I present visually in an interesting way? what kinds of visuals can I use to enhance my content?</p>

    <h2 class="red-heading">üìù Modular patterns are useful</h2>
    <p>I have learned that designing your website with modular patterns makes it easier to think about, easier to design, and easier to tailor to different screen sizes. As I implemented more of my website, I realised that much of the early work I did to establish a consistent design for each page paid off. It means that to make a new article, I simply need to copy a pre-made one and edit it with custom headings and custom paragraphs. It also means that tailoring my website to different screen sizes will be easier. Making one page responsive will make all other pages at least partly responsive without any extra work.</p>
    <p>Therefore, in future, I will make all levels of my website design modular.</p>

    <h2 class="blue-heading">‚õ∞Ô∏è Sticking to requirements is not always ideal</h2>
    <p>Working strictly by the given requirements of the client can hinder the quality of your website. I included an image map because it was part of the assignment specification, but using an image map in my article on story structure didn't create a good user experience. Linking to different pages felt clumsy, and was also not accessible to screen readers. I could have created a better user experience by using JavaScript to pop-up relevant information when each segment was clicked.</p>
    <p>In future, if I find myself working with a real client, I will probably receive similar requirements that I feel obligated to abide by. To deliver a valuable solution, I should be critical and suggest better alternatives when I identify them.</p>
