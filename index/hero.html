    <h1>How to Structure a Story</h1>

    <h2 class="green-heading">üìî Normal advice on structure</h2>
    <p>If you're in some literary circles, people will talk pretty loosely about story structure. Some will admit to writing at the edge of their seat -- they don't know what's about to happen next any more than the characters do. If you offer the same mindset to some screenwriters, you will be burnt at the stake. Ignoring 3-act structure, to them, is the greatest sin. It labels you immediately and unfailingly as the Screenwriter Whomst Is Bad.</p>
    <p>The reality is that there are numerous great stories with structures that defy these very different rules. So many that these rules can't convincingly hold as universal. Instead, we might want to think about why story structure holds so much meaning to us in the first place, and how we can use it as tool to achieve our desired ends.</p>

    <h2 class="red-heading">üìù Why we might want to structure stories</h2>
    <p>Consider the expression of an idea as a problem, and the way we use the medium of storytelling as a solution. If we want to understand this problem, and understand the desired solution, we can think in terms of French mathematician George P√≥lya's steps for problem solving:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>What idea do we want to express?</li>
      <li>What plan (using the medium of storytelling) have we made to express it effectively?</li>
      <li>How did we carry out this plan?</li>
      <li>How could this plan, and our process for carrying it out, be improved?</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We might understand steps 1, 3, and 4 as the spark, the process, and the self-critique respectively. Story structure fills the gap in the second step: it's our plan. And when you think about it, it's actually key to the whole process. You can't carry out a plan, step 3, if there is none. And you can't self-critique, step 4, if you don't know what you did in the first place!</p>
    <p>We carry out this problem solving process even if we don't think about it. But as we know, identifying things, exploring them, and discussing them are the cornerstone activites of human achievement. This is why story structure is so important. If we're able to identify its existence, explore how it works, and discuss it with others, we're well on our way to improving our craft and actually advancing the medium as a whole.</p>

    <h2 class="blue-heading" id="imagemap">‚õ∞Ô∏è How I like to structure my stories</h2>
    <p>I've identified story structure's existence with you. Now I want to explore and discuss how I structure many of my stories, as a reference. My plan is a messy hybrid of ideas I've picked up from different places, like Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey, Dan Harmon's Story Circle, and Robert McKee's Story.
