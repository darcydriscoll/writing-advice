    <h1>Good Writing Advice is a Tool</h1>

    <h2 class="green-heading">üìî How to Use Writing Advice</h2>
    <p>It can be tempting to take writing advice at face value, especially when you're starting out or struggling. Most advice comes from cults of personality, which strengthens this temptation. But before you absorb some pieces of advice, you might find it useful to consider why you write in the first place -- what writing means to you.</p>
    <p>Every piece of advice comes from someone with a different definition of what writing means to them. They are trying to project that meaning through the advice they give. Some meanings might resonate with you. Some might not. Still others might damage your self-worth, or weaken your confidence. Put advice in context, use it as a tool, and it will serve you better.</p>

    <h2 class="red-heading">üìù Examples of Writing Advice</h2>
    <p>Here are some pieces of advice from different authors that I find interesting. As you read them, you might consider how your reason for writing is similar or different to the author's reason for writing.</p>

    <div id="gallery">
      <h2>Image title</h2>
      <button id="gallery-previous" type="button">
        <img src="../images/right-arrow.png" alt="">
      </button>
      <button id="gallery-next" type="button">
        <img src="../images/right-arrow.png" alt="">
      </button>
      <div>
        <img id="gallery-image" src="#" alt="">
      </div>
      <p></p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="blue-heading" id="twitter-feed">üî• More examples of writing advice</h2>
    <p>Authority is the backbone of most writing advice. Authority is also the currency of social media. It's no wonder then that you can find snappy, sharable writing advice all over social media. Here's a Twitter timeline full of them. Does the kind of writing advice you find on social media help you write?</p>
