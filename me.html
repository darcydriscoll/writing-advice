    <h1>About me</h1>

    <h2 class="green-heading">üìî I'm passionate about writing stories</h2>
    <p>Some of my earliest memories are of me and my primary school friends roleplaying elaborate sci-fi plots at lunch time. I didn't really care about why I liked making stories back then, and I mostly still don't care now--it's just fun. But it's also
      an amazing form of self-expression that binds me to a greater purpose.</p>

    <h2 class="red-heading">üìù A website about how stories might work</h2>
    <p>The modern world is media-driven, and media is driven by stories. So, learning about how stories work should deepen your understanding of the world. </p>
    <p>With this website, I aim to share interesting opinions about how stories might work. Hopefully, this will expand both my and the user's understanding of storytelling and the world. These ideas will mostly be adapted from the ideas of other writers,
      filtered through a critical lens.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blue-heading">‚õ∞Ô∏è Writing advice should inspire</h2>
    <p>Much popular writing advice I see comes from people who use writing advice to sell books, market subscription services, get sponsorships, or just gain authority.</p>
    <p>To convince their audience, writing advice from these people is presented as factual and strong. This creates a standard to live up to, and if you don't meet this standard, you are not a 'good writer'. This is harmful.</p>
    <p>This website differs from the competition because it is a student project divorced from money, clout, and fame. While I do obviously have authority here (I'm in control of the website), I hope to use this authority to encourage critical thought rather
      than create insecurities.</p>
